## Linear Math Review

## Multiple Regression
Linear regression: estimating the Betahat of predictors
y = predictions
x = observations (matrix of n x K)
K = covariates

Y = XBeta + Epsilon

## OLS
Ordinary Least Squares is the method of minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE, Σ(actual-predicted)²) to estimate the Betahat
$$(X^TX)^-1X^TY$$
A perfect model assumes SSE = 0, there is no difference between the observed and predicted values. But there are usually more observations than predictors/covariates (K), so you have an over-determined systems annd there's no solutionn for Beta. So then the ... is transformed to the identity matrix...
