    "text": "Given that you are working extensively with modeling systems such as GAM, VAST and other regression approaches, which make use of parametric and nonparametric modeling methods as well as methods that incorporate spatial and temporal variation in the modeling process in various ways, I thought it might be good to try to define and review several of these modeling procedures. I’ve provided some of my lecture notes from my NTRES 6700 spatial statistics class as well as associate scripts to help you think through this topic. If you find there is something missing (e.g. a data set or another lecture or script that you think would be helpful to have) let me know. You may use the internet or any textbook or journal articles you wish in working through the questions below. But, I’m happy to provide input as well, so please let me know if you have any questions along the way."

    "text": "Modeling Approaches\n\nDefine the following modeling approaches, first very briefly in words, then via an equation and finally give an example of how they might be used in an applied setting:\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression: explains the relationship between 2 variables, where the response, or dependent variable, \\(Y_i\\) (matrix notation), is equal to a linear function of the predictor, or independent variable, \\(X\\), where the intercept is \\(\\alpha\\), and the slope of the line is \\(\\beta\\), a constant, times the value of the independent variable or predictor, \\(X\\). A constant change in the predictor leads to a constant change in the response. \\[Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta X_i\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication example\n\n\n\nThe inverse relationship between water temperature and depth, where water temperature decreases as depth increases.\n\n\n\nMultiple linear regression: explains the relationship between variables, where more than one predictor explains the response. The response, or dependent variable, \\(Y_i\\), is equal to a function of the independent variables or predictors, \\(X_n\\), and error, \\(\\epsilon\\). \\[Y_i = \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ...  \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon \\]\n\nParameter estimation is done with ordinary least squares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication example\n\n\n\nThe suitability of habitat for a terrestrial species where the relationship between the observation of a species, annual precipitation, ground cover type, and distance to an urban center predicts the suitability of a habitat for the terrestrial species.\n\n\nc-d*. Autoregressive model (AR): predicts the future response based on the past response, where there is a correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them. It is an expanded form of a linear regression, where the response, \\(Y\\), is dependent on \\(X\\) and the previous values of $Y$. Thus, the values of \\(X\\) at any time, $t$, are equal to the values of the previous \\(X_{t-1}\\) by the parameters, \\(\\varphi_1 , …, \\varphi_n\\) (or \\(\\Phi = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\varphi_i\\) ) and the previous error, \\(\\epsilon_t\\).\n\\[X_t =  \\Phi X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about…\n\n\n\nThe prediction of weather for today is based on what the weather was yesterday.\n\n\n\nAR(\\(\\Phi\\)): has no time series dependence between the terms, only error (or noise), where \\(\\Phi\\) = 0, thus, \\[X_t = \\epsilon_t\\].\nAR(1) model: the previous term (or previous step output), \\(X_{t-1}\\), and the error, \\(\\epsilon\\), contribute to the new term (or output). \\(\\Phi\\) , representing the parameters, is a positive number between 0 and 1. When \\(\\Phi\\) approaches 1, the previous terms contributes relatively more to the output than the error (noise). When -1 < \\(\\Phi\\) < 1, it is a stationary autoregressive model, where the mean and variance do not change over time. \\[X_t =  \\Phi X_t + \\epsilon_t\\]\nAR(2) model: the previous 2 terms (or previous 2 steps), \\(X_{t-1}\\), and error, \\(\\epsilon\\), contribute to the new term (or output), and \\(\\Phi\\) is a polynomial. \\[X_t =  \\Phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\Phi_2 X_{t-2} + \\epsilon_t\\]\n\nAn AR(2) model is stationary when -1 < \\(\\Phi\\) < 1, but non-stationary when \\(|\\Phi|\\) > 1.\n\nRandom walk: a random process for successive steps where the possibilities of the next step has equal probability, or in other words, the transition probability of going from one state to the next is equal. It is a special case of an autoregressive model, where the slope is equal to 1. \\[y(t) = B0 + B1*X(t-1) + e(t)\\]\nMarkov chain: a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events where each event depends on the previous event and is conditional on the present state. The transition probability of going from one state to the next is dependent on its finite set of states. Future and past states are independent. Example is the pattern of Brownian particle motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom walks can be an example of a Markov chain. OR maybe they are the same??\n\n\n\n\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo: stochastic simulation method, where the Markov chain has the distribution. The transition probabilities of the chain are designed so that the stationary probability of the chain is the probability distribution p with which we want to sample. One samples by taking a random walk until the probability distribution is close to the stationary distribution of the chain and then selects the point the walk is at.\nGeneralized Linear Model: an extension of the linear model where the error distribution of the response variable, \\(\\sigma\\) follows an exponential family distribution (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, gamma) with mean \\(\\mu_i\\). In a linear model, a constant change in the predictor leads to a constant change in the response, but here, the predictor is related to the response by a link function where the magnitude of the variance of each measurement is a function of its predicted value. This is useful when the relationship between response and predictor are not linear, thus, a linear relationship can be modeled by using the link function. Parameter estimation uses maximum likelihood estimation rather than ordinary least squares.\n\n\\[\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + ... + \\beta_p x_{pi }\\]\nlink \\(g(\\mu_i) = \\mu_i\\)\nVariance = \\(V(\\mu_i) = 1\\)\n\nGeneralized Additive Model: a generalized linear model in which the linear response variable depends linearly on a smooth function of the predictor variables.\n\n\n\nNonlinear model: regression model where the relationship between the response and predictors cannot be expressed by a linear combination and so the observational data are modeled by a function of a combination of parameters. The function is estimated through a series of approximations (iterations) to minimize the sum-of-squares.\nGeostatistical model: the spatial relationship, characterize by a mean and covariance. Assumes stationary, where the mean and the variance of the difference between two points a distance, h, apart is constant."
